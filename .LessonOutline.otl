Lesson Outline

Know a lot of things at this point 
	Machine learning models
	Some good for some, some for others
	Not only do ML models have paramters, but hyperparamters
	Zooming out, have covered a lot
		CRISPDM
		ETL 
		Four Step Data Science
		A lot to think about 
		Tools here to help 
			Pipelining
			Pickles
Pipeline
	IMO has two different defintions
		Python Specific
			Materials from LearnCo 
			Why do this? 
		Data Science General
			The big picture 
			Golden Rules
				Write Scripts with the future in mind 
				Version Control 
				Don't modify raw data 
Pickles
	In larger picture, not going to press go at start
	Why Good ?
		Scale in terms of sheer size of data
		Scale in terms of how long it takes to train
	Why Bad?
		Don't know what is hiding inside of pickle

Lab
	Putting it all together
	Set Up Github Repositiory 
		Now Version Controlled
	Set up directories with different data
		Raw data
		Clean Data 
		Pickles for Data 
		Scripts for each one 
	Run EDA 
		You know this
	Run ML Models 
		Make job easier with pipelines 
		Super time consuming 
		Save models as pickle  
	Insights
		Job is mostly prediction?
		Just need to optimize for speed and effeciency 
	Share
